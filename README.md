## This Starter has been deprecated, a single module version is available in https://github.com/vaadin/bookstore-example.

This repo is not updated anymore, but is still visible as an old example for migrating Vaadin 8 applications to Vaadin 10 [that can be found here](https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/migration/8-migration-example.html).

For a newer example, please see the project linked in the title or go to our [examples and demos page](https://vaadin.com/examples-and-demos).
